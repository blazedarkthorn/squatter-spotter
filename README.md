# Squatter Spotter - Form and depth checker
Pose estimation tracker using mediapipe and opencv in python that determines squat depth for powerlifting competitions. Lights displayed predicts what a left side, front and right side judge would rule the lift.

</br>Lights: O = white, - = red
</br>OOO = Good lift
</br>-OO = Left hip was high
</br>OO- = Right hip was high
</br>No lights = No lift

</br>Red box is to be lined up with combo rack arms to eliminate detecting side spotters.
